            <h2>International Youth Day: the IOC and Allianz reveal global research findings on youth participation in sport</h2>
            <p class="date">August 11, 2023</p>
            <p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Worldwide Olympic and Paralympic Insurance Partner Allianz SE (Allianz) have today announced initial global research findings* that reveal that 72% of young people think playing sport is important. Parents also recognise the benefits of sports participation, with over 90% saying they want their child to play sport to improve their physical and mental health. However, according to the research, young people report being less active due a number of everyday barriers and global issues, such as the cost of living (37%), climate change (30%) and the ongoing COVID-19 impact (34%).</p>

            <h2>The unanswered questions from the Qatar GP's mirror drama</h2>
            <p class="date">December 3, 2024</p>
            <p>Formula 1's Qatar Grand Prix, and potentially the fight for the constructors' championship, was turned on its head when Alex Albon's right mirror flew off his car and landed on the track. Race control's initial handling of the stranded mirror opened the door for the 10-second stop-and-go penalty that Lando Norris picked up and dropped him from challenging for the win to battling for a single point.</p>
